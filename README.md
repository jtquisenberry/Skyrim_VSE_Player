Skyrim Very Special Edition is a skill for Amazon Alexa devices. 

From Amazon:

"Bethesda Game Studios is proud to present Skyrim... for Alexa. Yes, that’s right, the version of Skyrim you never saw coming has finally arrived on the platform you never asked for.

For the very first time ever, take your rightful place as the Dragonborn of legend (again) and explore Skyrim using the power of your own voice...your Thu’um!"

The first version of Skyrim VSE was played using voice input. Alexa gained chatbot functionality and began accepting typed input late in 2020.
