===Ending===
There is not known to be a proper conclusion to Skyrim Very Special Edition. Instead, the game fails when the character's combined Shout, Spell, and Weapon levels reach 157 and the user attempts any action. 

=====Transcript=====

In this example, the character's levels starts at Shout = 1, Spell = 57, Weapon = 99. While fighting a Forsworn Warlord, the Spell level increased to 58, brining the combined skill level to 157. All actions following that point, including launching the Skyrim skill, fail and terminate the skill.

=====Warning about Caves=====

If the character is in a cave when the combined skill level reaches 146 and the character moves to a room containing an enemy, the game fails. The recommended course of action is to answer "No" when asked whether to enter a cave, starting at level 143.


=====Transcript with a Cave=====

In this example, the character entered a cave. The character's levels were at Shout = 6, Spell = 40, Weapon = 99. During the battle with the Ghost, Shout increased to Shout = 7, bringing the combined skill level to 146. After the battle, the character passed through two areas without enemies. Then, attempting to move to the next area crashed the game, stopping the Skyrim Very Special Edition skill. Unlike failure at level 157, it is possible to reenter the skill.
