====Ending====
There is not known to be a proper conclusion to Skyrim Very Special Edition. Instead, the game fails when the character's combined Shout, Spell, and Weapon levels reach 146 and the user attempts to move to a new location that contains an enemy. 

In this example, the character's levels start at Shout = 6, Spell = 40, Weapon = 99. During the battle with the Ghost, Shout increased to Shout = 7, bringing the combined level to 146. After the battle, the character passed through two areas without enemies. Then, attempting to move to the next area crashed the game, stopping the Skyrim Very Special Edition skill.

There are three paths forward: a pitch-black tunnel, a mine cart path, and a narrow tunnel. Which do you choose?
Request : Tunnel
Response: You move deeper into the cave. You peer through the darkness, struggling to see, then increase your gamma just a bit. There is an abandoned feast just lying on a table. Its not one of Lydias home cooked meals, but it will do. You heal to 78 health. There are two paths before you: a wooden ladder and a sturdy ladder. Which do you choose?
Request : Ladder
Response: You move deeper into the cave. A waterfall cascades from a shaft above filling the chamber with cool mist. Dozens of cheese wheels are scattered around the room. You eat all of them with reckless abandon. Your health is now at 100. There are two ways forward: a decaying old door and a barely-lit mineshaft. Which do you choose?
